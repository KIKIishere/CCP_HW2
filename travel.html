            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or  <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p>

            <h3>Geographical Location: Beijing, China</h3>
            <p>he Great Wall of China is broken up into different sections as opposed to being a continuous landmark. Each section holds its own merit to varying degrees of restoration and surrounding scenery.</p>
            <p>While many of the 'untouched' sections may seem more appealing and authentic, they’re actually very dangerous. If you want to traverse these remote sections of the wall, it’s best to sign up to a specialist hiking tour.  <a href ="https://anydoko.com/guide-to-beijing-the-great-wall-of-china/">The Great Wall</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourism of The Great Wall</a></p>
